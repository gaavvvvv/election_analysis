# Election Analysis / Project Overview
In this project I used VSCode and python to audit a huge file of election data. I used an excel csv file and under guidence wrote code to find out the winning candidates, their vote percentages, the county with the largest voter turnout, and the vote percentages by county. I then recorded the final findings in a separate text doc. 
## Total Votes
- 369,711
## The Candidates and Their Votes: 
- Diana DeGete with 73.8% of the total votes (272,892 votes) [WINNER]
- Charles Casper Stockham with 23.0% of the total votes (85,213 votes)
- Raymon Anthony Doane with 3.1% of the total votes (11,606 votes)
## The Counties and Their Votes
- Denver with 82.8% of total votes (306,055 votes) [COUNTY WITH LARGEST VOTER TURNOUT]
- Jefferson 10.5% (38,855 votes) 
- Arapahoe 6.7 %(24,801 votes)
## Election Audit Summary
- The election committee can utilize this script to help check to make sure future election results are accurate. We can also modify the script to check to see which candidate got votes were from which counties. If there is more election data to use such as voting location or voting city we can also sort and filter those data points out.
