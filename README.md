# election_analysis
In this project I learned how to use VSCode to practice python. I used an excel csv file with election data and under guidence wrote code to find out the winning candidates and their vote percentages. I then recorded the final findings in a separate text doc. 
The three candidates were Diana DeGete with 73.8% of the total votes (272,892 votes), Charles Casper Stockham with 23.0% of the total votes (85,213 votes), and Raymon Anthony Doane with 3.1% of the total votes (11,606).
